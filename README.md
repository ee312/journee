# Journee Itinerary Planner

Planning trips can be very stressful and time-consuming because there is just so much research involved. This project makes travel planning effortless by using AI to create custom itineraries that match the usersâ€™ unique needs, preferences, and budget. It will make travel easier and more enjoyable. 

For our tech stack, we use React.js for our front-end, Flask for our back-end, and MongoDB for our database. We use a travel API, Google Places API, which includes food, stay, and things to do. We use this along with Surprise Library, our AI model of choice.
