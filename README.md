# Journee Itinerary Planner

Planning trips can be very stressful and time-consuming because there is just so much research involved. This project makes travel planning effortless by using AI to create custom itineraries that match the usersâ€™ unique needs, preferences, and budget. It will make travel easier and more enjoyable. 

For our tech stack, we use React.js for our front-end, Flask for our back-end, and MongoDB for our database. We use a travel API, Google Places API, which includes food, stay, and things to do. We use this along with Surprise Library, our AI model of choice.

# how our project works
We use a three-tier architecture. We also use dot_env to secure our MonogDB URI, and some security imports as well for password security.

A little bit about how our project is structured: 


**Front-end (top tier)**

* Sends API request to back-end mediator 

* Uses websocket to update generated itinerary 

* Displays final itinerary on user page 


**Back-end Mediator (middle tier)**

* Accepts incoming requests
 
* Handle authentication

* Assign each request unique tracking ID

* fetch data (call API) 

* incorporate AI (use Surprise to generate trip) 

*final assembly (combine all data) 

* Return final itinerary back to front-end 

 

**Data Tier (bottom tier)**

* Fetch data  

  * Google Places API 

  * MongoDB 

* Send data to backend mediator
