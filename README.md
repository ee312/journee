Planning trips can be very stressful and time-consuming because there is just so much research involved. This project makes travel planning effortless by using AI to create custom itineraries that match the usersâ€™ unique needs, preferences, and budget. It will make travel easier and more enjoyable. 

For our tech stack, we use React.js for our front-end, Flask for our back-end, and MongoDB for our database. We use a travel API, Google Places API, which includes food, stay, and things to do. We use this along with Surprise Library, our AI model of choice.

# how our project works
We use a three-tier, event-driven architecture, using Celery as our queue, and WebSockets for the front-end event listener. We also use dot_env to secure our MonogDB URI.

A little bit about how our project is structured: 

** Front-end (top tier) **

* Queues request, on client side 

* Sends request one by one to back-end mediator, into a queue 

* Polls or listens indefinitely (maybe via event listener or other) for generated itinerary 

* Displays final itinerary on user page 

 

** Back-end Mediator (middle tier) **

* Accepts incoming requests from queue 

* Distributes tasks asynchronously across event channels 

  * fetch data (call API) 

  * incorporate AI (use Surprise to generate trip) 

  *final assembly (combine all data) 

* Return final itinerary back to front-end 

 

** Data Tier (bottom tier) **

*Fetch data  

  * Google Places API 

  * MongoDB 

* Send data to backend mediator
